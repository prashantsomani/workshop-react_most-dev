To run the project
--------------------

Be sure that you have GIT and NPM already installed in your machine and then fork this project.

First time running/updating packages, run

Hands-on
--------------------

Now it's your turn! 

The workshop was already presented and now you have to develop the project yourself.

You are going to use two end-points to get all the needed data.
- [Professionals list](http://www.mocky.io/v2/5d2c779e3100005200f5a948)
- [Positions type](http://www.mocky.io/v2/5d30565d32000092012043cc)

You can follow the layout available at [Zeplin](https://zpl.io/VKjmPq7) or you can also be creative and do your own design! Feel free to use any CSS library you want to (Bootstrap is already in the project).

Now you need to develop some filters:
- Filtering by position (using the given end-point)
- Filtering by availability
    - Assignment property: 
        - 'available' = 'none'
        - 'unavailable' != 'none'
- Order by (you are going to find more about it inside the code)

Icons and flags of all contries are already available in the project.

It has been also created some components to help you on your develop journey.
Don't forget: the simplest components, the best.
